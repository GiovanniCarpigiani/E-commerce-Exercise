# E-commerce-Exercise
In this exercise the aim is to module over a existing e-commerce and to code the new version from scratch. 
The model used is availiable on the link: www.experienciaspalaciotangara.com.br

My aim is to base my project on this gift voucher website, suggesting a new identity, as well as features. 
Also on this project I'll be using several programming languages such as HTML, CSS and Java Script on this Front End.
